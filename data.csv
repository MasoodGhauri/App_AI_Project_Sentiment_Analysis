"(CNN) -- Nineteen inmates were injured when a roof of a private prison collapsed Saturday near Lufkin, Texas, fire officials said. Ten prisoners were taken to hospitals by ambulance, and nine were transported as ""walking wounded"" from Diboll Correctional Center to area hospitals, according to prison officials.

"Some 29 militants also died, while three were captured, Sallal said, according to the state-run Algerian Press Service. The standoff ended Saturday, after four days, when Algerian special forces stormed the complex for the second time.

"After taking over, the well-armed militants planted explosives throughout the complex, Sallal said. They came from eight countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Niger, Canada and Mauritania. Algeria's military talked with the militants, but their demands that prisoners in the North African nation be released were deemed unreasonable, according to the prime minister. The country's special forces waged the assaults to free the hostages and were backed by the Algerian Air Force.

"At one point, the militants tried to flee the compound in vehicles that carried explosives and three or four hostages as human shields, Sallal said. At least two of the vehicles flipped and exploded during the attempt, he said. Sallal said the terrorists had entered the country from northern Mali, where Malian and French authorities are battling Islamist rebels. One-eyed veteran Islamist fighter Moktar Belmoktar has claimed responsibility for the hostage-taking on behalf of his al Qaeda-linked group, according to Mauritania's Sahara Media news agency.",1,0,1,0,0
"Belmokhtar -- who was among 12 defendants, five like him still on the run, who were the subject of an Algerian court hearing Monday related to their terrorist involvement -- said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali.

"Although Cecil, as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was at the helm when Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, he is close with the Clintons -- particularly Bill Clinton -- and worked as Hillary Clinton's national political and field director in 2008. Cecil is an unpretentious figure and has won the trust of many on Capitol Hill. Earlier in his career he led the standard journeyman campaign life, working for campaigns in Arkansas, North Carolina and Colorado (where he led Sen. Michael Bennet's dark-horse win in 2010). Cecil has been hesitant to talk about Clinton publicly as she considers a 2016 run and did not respond to an email for this story.",1,0,1,0,0
"Mook: The then 33-year-old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered Gov. Terry McAuliffe to victory in Virginia in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to Clinton as a smart choice for campaign manager. Before working for McAuliffe, Mook was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in 2008 steered the Clinton presidential campaign to wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana. Mook, who has a loyal following in his own Democratic circle, started his political career working for then Gov. Howard Dean in Vermont.",0,0,1,1,0

"Schriock currently has what she calls ""one of the very best jobs in American politics right now"" and it wouldn't be a stretch to say Hillary Clinton probably agrees. As head of Emily's List, Schriock's goal is to help elect pro-choice, Democratic women across the country -- something Clinton regularly talks about on the stump. Schriock, the often-on-message campaign veteran, started her career as Dean's 2004 finance director, where she tapped into a new revenue stream -- the internet -- to raise money. She then went on to lead high profile Senate campaigns, including Jon Tester's in Montana and Al Franken's in Minnesota, to wins. Schriock briefed the press at last month's Ready for Hillary strategy session, where she flatly said she was ""not going to talk about"" a possible role in the Clinton campaign.",0,0,1,0,0

"While Smith led Hillary Clinton's campaign to 2008 wins in California, Texas and North Carolina, it is the list of other Democrats he has worked for that is impressive: Richard Daley, Paul Simon, Ann Richards, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, to name a few. People close to Clinton say that Smith would be a good, outside-the-beltway choice for campaign manager.

I live near Coal River Mountain and my community is experiencing a tragedy.",1,1,1,0,0
"The situation here, before this disaster, had already compelled me to become an environmental activist, committed to doing everything I can to stop the destructive practice of coal extraction known as mountaintop removal. I am not trying to stop all coal mining. I believe coal mining will be with us for a very long time, considering our enormous thirst for energy and our slow transition to renewable energy. Throughout Appalachia, 2,000 miles of headwater streams have been destroyed and over 500 mountains have been decapitated by mountaintop removal. I stood by and did nothing until Massey Energy brought this fight to my door. Three years ago, Massey applied for a permit to blow the top off the mountain behind my house. The company plans to level 6,600 acres of Coal River Mountain and turn it into a moonscape where no living, breathing thing can survive. I believe a higher and better use for this mountain is the Coal River Wind Project.",1,0,1,0,0

Now, although these very proud, brave and strong men make about $70,000 a year, if they had a choice, many of them would never go underground again. The problem is that we live in a mono-economy and there are no choices. The coal industry has a death grip in the state of West Virginia and we have some of the best politicians money can buy. We also have some very honest, good and environmentally friendly politicians. Their numbers are small and it is considered to be political suicide to do anything in West Virginia that appears to be anti-coal.",1,0,1,0,0

I live at ground zero for mountaintop removal and because of the stand that I and many other people have taken to stop it, tensions run high in the coal fields. We are all being used by an outlaw industry and corrupt politicians and we are all driven by fear. The men who work in surface mining are terrified they will lose their jobs.

"Zubayr, who is also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane, already has a price on his head. In 2012, the U.S. State Department authorized a reward of up to $7 million for information on his whereabouts.

"Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the attack was directed at the Al-Shabaab leader and that ""we certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at."" But he didn't say who, if anyone, died in the attack. Zubayr's vision has been to transform Al-Shabaab from an insurgent outfit focused on Somalia into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond Somalia. He has already directed at least two: suicide bombings against bars in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010, and last year's Westgate mall siege in Nairobi, Kenya. After the Uganda attacks, which killed more than 70 people, Zubayr warned: ""What happened in Kampala was just the beginning.""",1,0,1,0,0
"One key suspect in the Kampala attacks, known as Jabir, allegedly was an explosives instructor and answered directly to Zubayr. Jabir is known to have visited Uganda at least four times before the July 2010 attack. The source in Mogadishu told CNN last year: ""Zubayr is creating Al-Shabaab 2.0."" For Zubayr, the struggle has always been a global confrontation with ""disbelievers"" rather than just about Somalia. He also vowed that his group would launch a direct attack against the United States.",1,0,1,0,0
"Zubayr is 37, according to most accounts, and originally from Somaliland, now a vaguely autonomous part of northern Somalia. He is slim to the point of wispy, as shown in the few photographs of him, and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public. As a teenager, he studied at a Pakistani madrasa, thanks to a grant from a wealthy Saudi, and he returned home with militant beliefs. He was thought to have been involved in the abduction and killings of foreign aid workers in Somaliland, including the death of Italian aid worker Annalena Tonelli in 2003. Among his close associates in Al-Shabaab's early days was Aden Ayrow, a towering force in the group and a ruthless and mercurial pro-al Qaeda hard-liner. After Ayrow's death in May 2008 in a U.S. strike, Zubayr asserted his leadership of Al-Shabaab and immediately pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2009, he once refused to discuss a military offensive against government forces in Mogadishu with Al-Shabaab's allies until one of them apologized for remarks he had made critical of bin Laden.",1,0,1,0,0
"But bin Laden was wary of an al Qaeda merger with Al-Shabaab. About a year before his death, he wrote to Zubayr that enemies would ""escalate their anger and mobilize against you. This is what happened to the brothers in Iraq or Algeria."" Bin Laden's deputy at that time, Ayman al-Zawahiri, took a different view. A letter dated December 2010, which was recovered from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and was thought by researchers to have been written by al-Zawahiri, was critical of bin Laden's decision to rebuff entreaties by the Somali militant group. ""I see it to be very essential for al Qaeda to confirm and declare its linkage with its branches. ... Please reconsider your opinion not to declare the accession of the brothers of Somalia,"" the author wrote.",1,0,1,0,0
"In February 2012, Zubayr formally declared Al-Shabaab an affiliate of al Qaeda with a long message to al-Zawahiri in which he said: ""We will go with you as loyal soldiers until doom and injustice disappear from Islam."" Zubayr has always rejected any negotiations with Somalia's transitional federal government. According to another U.S. diplomatic cable unearthed by WikiLeaks, Zubayr rejected an initiative in 2009 by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi to mediate in Somalia, telling him that once a true Islamic government was established in Somalia, he would move on to other countries, including Libya. He opposes elections, saying, ""The reality is that democracy is something Allah made unlawful, and someone else cannot make it lawful.""",1,0,1,0,0
"As Al-Shabaab came under greater pressure from the African Union force stationed in Mogadishu, Zubayr turned to suicide bombings against civilians. In December 2009, an Al-Shabaab bomber killed 23 people at a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu. Some factions inside Al-Shabaab disowned the attack, but Zubayr was unmoved. As a northerner, unlike other Al-Shabaab commanders, he did not belong to a clan in the areas controlled by the group and was therefore less concerned about civilian casualties. According to a confidential U.N. assessment, Zubayr demanded more suicide attacks to supplement conventional fighting. At least two such suicide attacks have come this year: a May attack on a restaurant popular with foreigners in the city of Djibouti and failed attacks on a presidential compound in Mogadishu.",1,0,1,0,0
"Zubayr's rejection of negotiations, poor management of military campaigns and the clan system soon led to dissent in Al-Shabaab. According to diplomatic cables in 2009, Zubayr wanted to declare an Islamic caliphate in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab, which included much of central and southern Somalia. Others in Al-Shabaab's leadership disagreed, saying the group had to gain greater public support before such a move. But fearful of assassination, they kept their counsel. The imposition of brutal Taliban-like law eventually alienated large sections of the population in southern and central Somalia. One prominent Al-Shabaab member, the American Omar Hammami, said in a video in 2012 that other elements in the group were trying to kill him. He followed up with a series of tweets attacking Zubayr.",1,0,0,0,0
"""Abu Zubayr has gone mad. He's starting a civil war,"" he tweeted. Zubayr responded by ordering the killing of Hammami, who was wounded by a gunshot in April 2013. His intelligence wing caught up with Hammami months later and killed him, just days after he told the Voice of America that Zubayr had ""turned Al-Shabaab into an organization that oppresses Muslims in an effort to win control of Somalia."" Even longtime supporters and friends, such as Ibrahim al Afghani, turned against Zubayr, and paid with their lives. Al Afghani was killed in a shootout in June 2013 in the southern town of Barowe.",1,0,1,0,0
"The Mogadishu source told CNN that prominent figures in Al-Shabaab -- including Sheikh Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys -- now fear for their lives. Zubayr's purge accelerated during the summer of 2013, leading Aweys to negotiate his surrender to authorities, apparently for his own protection. After a Kenyan-led military operation pushed Al-Shabaab out of population centers in 2011, pro-al Qaeda hawks within the group gained the upper hand. The loss of the port city of Kismayo, the source of much of Al-Shabaab's income, weakened arguments that the group had too much to lose by embracing al Qaeda's global jihad. One reason Zubayr has emerged triumphant in these internal battles is that he controls Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing, known as Amniyat, a ruthless entity organized in cells and commanded by Mahad Mohamed Ali, also known as ""Karate.""",0,0,1,0,0
"Counterterrorism analysts say that as other units in the group have been weakened, Zubayr has come to rely heavily on Amniyat, which he sees as the kernel for Al-Shabaab's transformation into a regional al Qaeda affiliate. Zubayr's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside Somalia, and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to al Qaeda. After the Westgate attack, Kenyan and Western intelligence agencies stepped up efforts to end Zubayr's reign of terror, but it remains unclear if this week's airstrike against him succeeded.",1,0,1,0,0

"(CNN) -- Thirty-two years ago, President Ronald Reagan launched an era of anti-government politics with his first inaugural address. On Monday, President Barack Obama offered the best rebuttal to date. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer said the speech marked ""the end of Reaganism,"" and I couldn't agree more. Like Reagan, the president sought to ground the national conversation in his own definition of patriotism. But instead of the ""liberty-only"" patriotism of Reagan and political descendants such as Paul Ryan, who would turn love of country into hate for its government and its people, Obama offered a deeper ""liberty and justice for all"" patriotism.",1,0,1,0,0
"Obama noted that the world has changed -- that global problems cause local disasters, and what happens across town affects you and your neighbors -- and he called on us all to realize that you cannot have liberty for all without justice for all. Opinion: World to Obama -- You can't ignore us Perhaps most fittingly, on a day heavy with memory, the president invoked those who once stood on the National Mall to hear a different type of founding father -- ""a king (who proclaimed) that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.""",0,0,1,0,0
"The overtones of Reagan's 1981 speech rang so loudly, in fact, that it's clear the president and his team looked to that address as inspiration. Reagan offered up a vision of an over-taxed, long-neglected ""We the People""; Obama's version of ""We the People"" is youthful, diverse, energetic and engaged. Both saw their addresses as a call to arms for all Americans. Both sought to tie the best traditions of our founding fathers to today's challenges. Both insisted that what truly drives America is the ingenuity and independence of our people.",0,0,1,0,0
"Opinion: Obama finally meets Machiavelli But while Reagan advanced the simplistic idea that government and liberty are always at odds, Obama's speech reflected the realizations of a new century. Instead of ""government is the problem,"" the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed.",0,0,1,0,0
"Like Reagan, the president invoked the names of famous places in American history -- but instead of battles, he tied Stonewall in with Selma and cemented his declaration that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights. Coming off an election during which today's Reaganites insulted a nation of ""takers,"" the president declared that Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security ""free us to take the risks that make this country great."" Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism",0,0,1,0,0
"This was not a partisan speech. It was not a campaign rally. But it showed that Obama will not back away from a fight. He is staking a bet that a rising generation has a new vision for the country. I do not think that following through will be easy, or that the president will do everything right. But he showed Monday that he is standing on the right side of history.

"Jones: Obama's address also shows he is standing on the right side of history Hundreds of dolphins that washed up on Peruvian shores died of natural causes, a government official said in a radio interview Tuesday. ""One of the things that we can confirm is that ... the deaths of the dolphins were not caused by any human activity, and this is a very important subject,"" Peruvian Production Minister Gladys Triveno told RPP Radio.",1,0,0,1,0
"Government investigators have also ruled out theories that bacteria or a virus could be behind the deaths, she said, adding that further details would be revealed in a report from the Sea Institute of Peru released Tuesday. ""It is natural causes. It is a natural death, and also the report explains the process of natural selection. Let's say that the species that are more prepared, the dolphins that are more prepared, are those that are going to survive,"" Triveno said. ""And this happens periodically. This is not the first time it has happened. And it is not only happening in Peru, but also has happened in New Zealand, in Australia, in other countries where these phenomena happen."" According to the report, authorities sent specimens to no fewer than four laboratories for a battery of tests.",1,0,1,0,0
"The results ruled out a number of theories of the cause of death. Hunger, interaction with fishermen, pesticides, bacterial infections, viral infections and heavy metals contamination were all ruled out. The appearance of nearly 900 dead dolphins in a 220-kilometer (137-mile) area in northern Peru so far this year, and the deaths of thousands of pelicans there and in neighboring Chile, have sparked concern among local residents and environmentalists. At least one Peruvian environmental group has said loud sounds from nearby oil exploration could be to blame for the dolphins' deaths.",1,0,0,0,0
"""We see that in their bodies there are air bubbles caused by heavy pressure. These animals are underwater holding their breath, facing a sudden and violent noise. These animals release nitrogen, and this forms the bubbles that end up destroying living cells,"" Carlos Yaipen-Llanos of the Scientific Organization for the Conservation of  Aquatic Animals told CNN en Español this month. Government officials have dismissed that assessment, arguing that it is not supported by evidence. The report explained that the dead dolphins began washing up on the shore before the seismic activity started and that similar activity in the past has not been linked to marine deaths.",1,0,1,0,0
"This month, Peruvian authorities said warm waters off that country's coast were to blame for the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds. The Peruvian Ministry of Environment said seafood is still safe to eat and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen, according to the state-run Andina news agency. The report suggested some courses of action, including the creation of a task force among multiple agencies to implement programs for caring for the marine ecosystem.",1,1,0,1,0
"It also called for an awareness campaign about Peruvian ocean life and its conservation, aimed at the general public. The dolphin deaths in Peru mark the third set of high-profile strandings in the past several months. In February, 179 dolphins --108 of which were dead -- washed ashore in Cape Cod, in the eastern United States, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Marine biologists are still trying to determine the cause of those deaths.",1,0,0,0,1

"Fawziya Ammodi struggled for three days in labor, before dying of severe bleeding at a hospital on Friday, said the Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children. ""Although the cause of her death was lack of medical care, the real case was the lack of education in Yemen and the fact that child marriages keep happening,"" said Seyaj President Ahmed al-Qureshi. Born into an impoverished family in Hodeidah, Fawziya was forced to drop out of school and married off to a 24-year-old man last year, al-Qureshi said.",1,0,1,0,0
"Child brides are commonplace in Yemen, especially in the Red Sea Coast where tribal customs hold sway. Hodeidah is the fourth largest city in Yemen and an important port. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 -- many times to older men, some with more than one wife, a study by Sanaa University found. While it was not immediately known why Fawziya's parents married her off, the reasons vary. Sometimes, financially-strapped parents offer up their daughters for hefty dowries.",0,1,1,0,0
"Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. And often, parents will extract a promise from the husband to wait until the girl is older to consummate the marriage. Children's organization UNICEF issued a statement Monday saying: ""Child marriages violate the rights of children in the most deplorable way. The younger the girl is when she becomes pregnant, the greater the health risks for her and her baby. ""Girls who give birth before the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Child marriage denies girls of their childhood, deprives them of an education and robs them of their innocence.""",0,1,1,0,0
